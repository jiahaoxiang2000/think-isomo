# Think Notes - isomo

Personal reflections and thoughts organized by topic and timeline, beautifully typeset with Typst.

## Overview

This repository contains my personal notes and reflections on various topics, organized thematically with chronological progression. The content is written in a mix of Chinese and English, leveraging Typst's excellent multilingual typography support.

## Structure

The notes are organized by topic folders, with each file named by date:

```

### Organization Principles

- **Topic Classification**: Content is organized by theme in separate folders
- **Chronological Ordering**: Files within each topic are named by date (`YYYY-MM-DD.typ`)
- **Dual Perspective**: View content by topic or follow the timeline across topics

## Building

### Prerequisites

- [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst) (latest version)
- Source Han Serif fonts (for Chinese typography)

### Local Compilation

```bash
typst compile think-isomo.typ
```

### Automated Releases

When you push a version tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`), GitHub Actions automatically:
1. Installs Source Han Serif fonts
2. Compiles the document
3. Creates a release with the PDF named `think-isomo-v1.0.0.pdf`

To create a release:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```
